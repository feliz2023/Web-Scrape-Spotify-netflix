# Web-Scrape-Spotify1-

This project is a demonstration of Spotify scraping. Upon running the code, the program automatically opens the login page, fills in the user's email and password, unchecks the "remember me" radio button, and logs in. Additionally, the program opens the "Edit Profile" option and changes the user's gender. 

To make this project even more functional, further systems automation could be implemented. Thank you for considering this project. Have a great day!
